Ensure that the configuration and initialization settings in your code are as specified in the Langchain documentation.\\n\\n2. **API Keys and Credentials**: Ensure that any necessary API keys or credentials are correctly implemented in your project. Missing or incorrect credentials can prevent proper communication with Smith Langchain.\\n\\n3. **Environment Variables**: Make sure that environment variables are set correctly, if required. These might include API keys, project IDs, or any other configuration settings.\\n\\n4. **Network Issues**: Check your network connection to ensure there are no issues that might be preventing your project from connecting to Smith Langchain's services.\\n\\n5. **Logging and Debugging**: Enable logging in your project to see if there are any error messages or warnings during execution. This can provide insights into what might be going wrong.\\n\\n6. **Updates and Compatibility**: Make sure that your Langchain library is up to date. Check for any updates or patches that might address your issue.\\n\\n7. **Documentation Revisions**: Verify if there have been any recent updates or changes in the Langchain documentation that might affect your setup.\\n\\n8. **Community and Support**: Consider reaching out to the Langchain community or support channels. Other users or developers might have experienced similar issues and could offer solutions.\\n\\n9. **Check for Known Issues**: Look into any known issues or bug reports related to Smith Langchain that might align with the problems you're facing.\\n\\nIf you've gone through these steps and the issue persists, providing specific error messages or code snippets might help others assist you better.\", additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 358, 'prompt_tokens': 53, 'total_tokens': 411, 'completion_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': None, 'reasoning_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': None, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-2024-08-06', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_90354628f2', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-f3afd2c4-10ce-466d-bfb3-e184a388f03b-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 53, 'output_tokens': 358, 'total_tokens': 411, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'reasoning': 0}})"
