AgentRelease policySecurityTutorialsBuild a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) AppOn this pageBuild a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) App\\nOne of the most powerful applications enabled by LLMs is sophisticated question-answering (Q&A) chatbots. These are applications that can answer questions about specific source information. These applications use a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG.\\nThis tutorial will show how to build a simple Q&A application\\nover a text data source. Along the way we‚Äôll go over a typical Q&A\\narchitecture and highlight additional resources for more advanced Q&A techniques. We‚Äôll also see\\nhow LangSmith can help us trace and understand our application.\\nLangSmith will become increasingly helpful as our application grows in\\ncomplexity.\\nIf you\\'re already familiar with basic retrieval, you might also be interested in\\nthis high-level overview of different retrieval techinques.\\nWhat is RAG?\\u200b\\nRAG is a technique for augmenting LLM knowledge with additional data.\\nLLMs can reason about wide-ranging topics, but their knowledge is limited to the public data up to a specific point in time that they were trained on. If you want to build AI applications that can reason about private data or data introduced after a model\\'s cutoff date, you need to augment the knowledge of the model with the specific information it needs. The process of bringing the appropriate information and inserting it into the model prompt is known as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).\\nLangChain has a number of components designed to help build Q&A applications, and RAG applications more generally.\\nNote: Here we focus on Q&A for unstructured data. If you are interested for RAG over structured data, check out our tutorial on doing question/answering over SQL data.\\nConcepts\\u200b\\nA typical RAG application has two main components:\\nIndexing: a pipeline for ingesting data from a source and indexing it. This usually happens offline.\\nRetrieval and generation: the actual RAG chain, which takes the user query at run time and retrieves the relevant data from the index, then passes that to the model.\\nThe most common full sequence from raw data to answer looks like:\\nIndexing\\u200b\\n\\nLoad: First we need to load our data. This is done with Document Loaders.\\nSplit: Text splitters break large Documents into smaller chunks. This is useful both for indexing data and for passing it in to a model, since large chunks are harder to search over and won\\'t fit in a model\\'s finite context window.\\nStore: We need somewhere to store and index our splits, so that they can later be searched over. This is often done using a VectorStore and Embeddings model.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval and generation\\u200b\\n\\nRetrieve: Given a user input, relevant splits are retrieved from storage using a Retriever.\\nGenerate: A ChatModel / LLM produces an answer using a prompt that includes the question and the retrieved data\\n\\n\\nSetup\\u200b\\nJupyter Notebook\\u200b\\nThis guide (and most of the other guides in the documentation) uses Jupyter notebooks and assumes the reader is as well. Jupyter notebooks are perfect for learning how to work with LLM systems because oftentimes things can go wrong (unexpected output, API down, etc) and going through guides in an interactive environment is a great way to better understand them.\\nThis and other tutorials are perhaps most conveniently run in a Jupyter notebook. See here for instructions on how to install.\\nInstallation\\u200b\\nThis tutorial requires these langchain dependencies:\\n\\nPipConda%pip install --quiet --upgrade langchain langchain-community langchain-chromaconda install langchain langchain-community langchain-chroma -c conda-forge\\nFor more details, see our Installation guide.\\nLangSmith\\u200b\\nMany of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls.\\nAs these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent.\\nThe best way to do this is with LangSmith.\\nAfter you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:\\nexport LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=\"true\"export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=\"...\"\\nOr, if in a notebook, you can set them with:\\nimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2\"] = \"true\"os.environ[\"LANGCHAIN_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()\\nPreview\\u200b\\nIn this guide we‚Äôll build an app that answers questions about the content of a website. The specific website we will use is the LLM Powered Autonomous\\nAgents blog post\\nby Lilian Weng, which allows us to ask questions about the contents of\\nthe post.\\nWe can create a simple indexing pipeline and RAG chain to do this in ~20\\nlines of code:\\n\\nOpenAIAnthropicAzureGoogleCohereNVIDIAFireworksAIGroqMistralAITogetherAIAWSpip install -qU langchain-openaiimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAIllm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\")pip install -qU langchain-anthropicimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropicllm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\")pip install -qU langchain-openaiimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_openai import AzureChatOpenAIllm = AzureChatOpenAI(    azure_endpoint=os.environ[\"AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT\"],    azure_deployment=os.environ[\"AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME\"],    openai_api_version=os.environ[\"AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION\"],)pip install -qU langchain-google-vertexaiimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_google_vertexai import ChatVertexAIllm = ChatVertexAI(model=\"gemini-1.5-flash\")pip install -qU langchain-cohereimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"COHERE_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_cohere import ChatCoherellm = ChatCohere(model=\"command-r-plus\")pip install -qU langchain-nvidia-ai-endpointsimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"NVIDIA_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain import ChatNVIDIAllm = ChatNVIDIA(model=\"meta/llama3-70b-instruct\")pip install -qU langchain-fireworksimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"FIREWORKS_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_fireworks import ChatFireworksllm = ChatFireworks(model=\"accounts/fireworks/models/llama-v3p1-70b-instruct\")pip install -qU langchain-groqimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"GROQ_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_groq import ChatGroqllm = ChatGroq(model=\"llama3-8b-8192\")pip install -qU langchain-mistralaiimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"MISTRAL_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_mistralai import ChatMistralAIllm = ChatMistralAI(model=\"mistral-large-latest\")pip install -qU langchain-openaiimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"TOGETHER_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAIllm = ChatOpenAI(    base_url=\"https://api.together.xyz/v1\",    api_key=os.environ[\"TOGETHER_API_KEY\"],    model=\"mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1\",)pip install -qU langchain-aws# Ensure your AWS credentials are configuredfrom langchain_aws import ChatBedrockllm = ChatBedrock(model_id=\"anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0\")\\nimport bs4from langchain import hubfrom langchain_chroma import Chromafrom langchain_community.document_loaders import WebBaseLoaderfrom langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParserfrom langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthroughfrom langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddingsfrom langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter# Load, chunk and index the contents of the blog.loader = WebBaseLoader(    web_paths=(\"https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/\",),    bs_kwargs=dict(        parse_only=bs4.SoupStrainer(            class_=(\"post-content\", \"post-title\", \"post-header\")        )    ),)docs = loader.load()text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200)splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)vectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings())# Retrieve and generate using the relevant snippets of the blog.retriever = vectorstore.as_retriever()prompt = hub.pull(\"rlm/rag-prompt\")def format_docs(docs):    return \"\\\\n\\\\n\".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs)rag_chain = (    {\"context\": retriever | format_docs, \"question\": RunnablePassthrough()}    | prompt    | llm    | StrOutputParser())rag_chain.invoke(\"What is Task Decomposition?\")API Reference:WebBaseLoader | StrOutputParser | RunnablePassthrough | OpenAIEmbeddings | RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\\n\\'Task Decomposition is a process where a complex task is broken down into smaller, simpler steps or subtasks.

Even for those models that could\\nfit the full post in their context window, models can struggle to find\\ninformation in very long inputs.\\nTo handle this we‚Äôll split the Document into chunks for embedding and\\nvector storage. This should help us retrieve only the most relevant bits\\nof the blog post at run time.\\nIn this case we‚Äôll split our documents into chunks of 1000 characters\\nwith 200 characters of overlap between chunks. The overlap helps\\nmitigate the possibility of separating a statement from important\\ncontext related to it. We use the\\nRecursiveCharacterTextSplitter,\\nwhich will recursively split the document using common separators like\\nnew lines until each chunk is the appropriate size. This is the\\nrecommended text splitter for generic text use cases.\\nWe set add_start_index=True so that the character index at which each\\nsplit Document starts within the initial Document is preserved as\\nmetadata attribute ‚Äústart_index‚Äù.\\nfrom langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplittertext_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(    chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=200, add_start_index=True)all_splits = text_splitter.split_documents(docs)len(all_splits)API Reference:RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter\\n66\\nlen(all_splits[0].page_content)\\n969\\nall_splits[10].metadata\\n{\\'source\\': \\'https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2023-06-23-agent/\\', \\'start_index\\': 7056}\\nGo deeper\\u200b\\nTextSplitter: Object that splits a list of Documents into smaller\\nchunks.

Indexing: Store\\u200b\\nNow we need to index our 66 text chunks so that we can search over them\\nat runtime. The most common way to do this is to embed the contents of\\neach document split and insert these embeddings into a vector database\\n(or vector store). When we want to search over our splits, we take a\\ntext search query, embed it, and perform some sort of ‚Äúsimilarity‚Äù\\nsearch to identify the stored splits with the most similar embeddings to\\nour query embedding. The simplest similarity measure is cosine\\nsimilarity ‚Äî\\xa0we measure the cosine of the angle between each pair of\\nembeddings (which are high dimensional vectors).\\nWe can embed and store all of our document splits in a single command\\nusing the Chroma\\nvector store and\\nOpenAIEmbeddings\\nmodel.\\nfrom langchain_chroma import Chromafrom langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddingsvectorstore = Chroma.from_documents(documents=all_splits, embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings())API Reference:OpenAIEmbeddings\\nGo deeper\\u200b\\nEmbeddings: Wrapper around a text embedding model, used for converting\\ntext to embeddings.\\n\\nDocs: Detailed documentation on how to use embeddings.\\nIntegrations: 30+ integrations to choose from.\\nInterface: API reference for the base interface.\\n\\nVectorStore: Wrapper around a vector database, used for storing and\\nquerying embeddings.\\n\\nDocs: Detailed documentation on how to use vector stores.\\nIntegrations: 40+ integrations to choose from.\\nInterface: API reference for the base interface.\\n\\nThis completes the Indexing portion of the pipeline. At this point\\nwe have a query-able vector store containing the chunked contents of our\\nblog post. Given a user question, we should ideally be able to return\\nthe snippets of the blog post that answer the question.\\n4. Retrieval and Generation: Retrieve\\u200b\\nNow let‚Äôs write the actual application logic. We want to create a simple\\napplication that takes a user question, searches for documents relevant\\nto that question, passes the retrieved documents and initial question to\\na model, and returns an answer.\\nFirst we need to define our logic for searching over documents.\\nLangChain defines a\\nRetriever interface\\nwhich wraps an index that can return relevant Documents given a string\\nquery.\\nThe most common type of Retriever is the\\nVectorStoreRetriever,\\nwhich uses the similarity search capabilities of a vector store to\\nfacilitate retrieval.

Use three sentences maximum and keep the answer concise.Question: filler question Context: filler context Answer:\\nWe‚Äôll use the LCEL Runnable\\nprotocol to define the chain, allowing us to\\n\\npipe together components and functions in a transparent way\\nautomatically trace our chain in LangSmith\\nget streaming, async, and batched calling out of the box.\\n\\nHere is the implementation:\\nfrom langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParserfrom langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthroughdef format_docs(docs):    return \"\\\\n\\\\n\".join(doc.page_content for doc in docs)rag_chain = (    {\"context\": retriever | format_docs, \"question\": RunnablePassthrough()}    | prompt    | llm    | StrOutputParser())for chunk in rag_chain.stream(\"What is Task Decomposition?\"):    print(chunk, end=\"\", flush=True)API Reference:StrOutputParser | RunnablePassthrough\\nTask Decomposition is a process where a complex task is broken down into smaller, more manageable steps or parts. This is often done using techniques like \"Chain of Thought\" or \"Tree of Thoughts\", which instruct a model to \"think step by step\" and transform large tasks into multiple simple tasks. Task decomposition can be prompted in a model, guided by task-specific instructions, or influenced by human inputs.\\nLet\\'s dissect the LCEL to understand what\\'s going on.\\nFirst: each of these components (retriever, prompt, llm, etc.) are instances of Runnable. This means that they implement the same methods-- such as sync and async .invoke, .stream, or .batch-- which makes them easier to connect together. They can be connected into a RunnableSequence-- another Runnable-- via the | operator.\\nLangChain will automatically cast certain objects to runnables when met with the | operator. Here, format_docs is cast to a RunnableLambda, and the dict with \"context\" and \"question\" is cast to a RunnableParallel. The details are less important than the bigger point, which is that each object is a Runnable.\\nLet\\'s trace how the input question flows through the above runnables.\\nAs we\\'ve seen above, the input to prompt is expected to be a dict with keys \"context\" and \"question\". So the first element of this chain builds runnables that will calculate both of these from the input question:\\n\\nretriever | format_docs passes the question through the retriever, generating Document objects, and then to format_docs to generate strings;\\nRunnablePassthrough() passes through the input question unchanged.\\n\\nThat is, if you constructed\\nchain = (    {\"context\": retriever | format_docs, \"question\": RunnablePassthrough()}    | prompt)\\nThen chain.invoke(question) would build a formatted prompt, ready for inference. (Note: when developing with LCEL, it can be practical to test with sub-chains like this.)\\nThe last steps of the chain are llm, which runs the inference, and StrOutputParser(), which just plucks the string content out of the LLM\\'s output message.\\nYou can analyze the individual steps of this chain via its LangSmith\\ntrace.\\nBuilt-in chains\\u200b\\nIf preferred, LangChain includes convenience functions that implement the above LCEL. We compose two functions:\\n\\ncreate_stuff_documents_chain specifies how retrieved context is fed into a prompt and LLM. In this case, we will \"stuff\" the contents into the prompt -- i.e., we will include all retrieved context without any summarization or other processing. It largely implements our above rag_chain, with input keys context and input-- it generates an answer using retrieved context and query.\\ncreate_retrieval_chain adds the retrieval step and propagates the retrieved context through the chain, providing it alongside the final answer. It has input key input, and includes input, context, and answer in its output.\\n\\nfrom langchain.chains import create_retrieval_chainfrom langchain.chains.combine_documents import create_stuff_documents_chainfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplatesystem_prompt = (    \"You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. \"    \"Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer \"    \"the question.

Techniques like Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thoughts are used to enhance model performance on these tasks.
